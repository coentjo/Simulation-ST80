# Simulation ST-80

Reading in the Blue Book about the Smalltalk-80 Simulation classes. I got curious where to find them and if they were still useful. Trying it here... 

Found a zip at:

Downloaded the zip and getting started!


## Filing in 

Using Pharo 11.0, 64-bit stable, 
created and launched with PharoLauncher, 
Open FileBrowser on files and file in one-by-one, starting 
with the '01', '02' and so on, doing the 'zz_..' last.

Find the classes by opening (in a System Browser) the packages
Statistics and Simulations.
